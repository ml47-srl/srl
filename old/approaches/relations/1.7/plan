# plan

Current laws:
1. true <-> any rule
2. functions can be executed
3. insertion of variables

Ideas:
- Anyhow prohibit the use of specific laws in argument-lists (eg. const() / <streq>() should not allow law 1/2)
- Implementing number cells (1.6: ! or ?)

Unclear:
- Can I implement constants or number cells in the current srl 1.7?
- Can I implement sets?
