SRL
===

SRL is basically a language to represent systems.

It should be able to accurately specify any system.
Mainly SRL should be a spoken language,
but because of its accuracy is writing scripts to work with systems pretty easy.
Ideas for these scripts are noted below.

- Ask questions referring to this system
	- like in prolog
- Check for knowledge-conflicts
	- Sometimes the rules you enter to create a system except each other. (eg. 0^a = 0 and b^0 = 1 -> whats 0^0 ?)
