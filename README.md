SRL
===
SRL = System Representing Language

## Requirements
SRL should be a format of information storage and a logical language.<br />
Information should be saved in rules (sentences). <br /><br />

SRL should be capable of a **precise** and **flexible** derivation-principle.<br />
This principle should allow the author to define explicit rules, which imply other rules.<br />
e.g. "every day has a sunrise and a sunset" implies "today has a sunrise and a sunset".<br /><br />

SRL should be pronounceable.<br />
SRL should not give a chance of misunderstandings when read or spoken.<br /><br />

There shouldn't be rules which are true, but can not be derivated from anything.<br />

The derivation-principle of SRL should be relatively simple, because this makes SRL easy to learn and process.<br />
