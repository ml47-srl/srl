The Reduced Featureset contains
- simple cells ("a word containing the letters a-z and A-Z, _, =; they work like Variables in some ways")
- complex cells ("A List of cells, seperated with spaces, the length of the list may only be 2 or 3")
- equality ("The complex cell "(= a b)", represents as a bool (true or false), whether a and b are equal, which means interchangeable; All cells are equal to itself")
- scopes ("A way to say that a specific logic applies to all cells; They are boolean expressions, and look like this: {0 <cell>}, where <cell> is any cell: This means: "for every 0 applies cell", which makes more sense, if 0 and cell are explicit things..")
