# subplan

method 1:
class Substitution { old="a(b)."; sub="b->c" }

- cspot and more specifications are needed (specifies where to substitute, if multiple occurences (of b) exist)
+ SubRule::allows() is easy

method 2:
class Substitution { old="a(b)."; new="a(c)." }

- SubRule::allows() is hard to code
	+ diff maybe helps
