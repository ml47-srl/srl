# plan

Ideas:
- Conditions for SubRules (<condition>: a -> b.)
- Substituting in SubRules not only RelRules
- Implementing number cells (1.6: ! or ?)
- Testroom
- "-->"? (forced occur=-1)
- "<->"?

Unclear:
- Can I implement constants or number cells in the current srl 2.0?
- Can I implement sets?
