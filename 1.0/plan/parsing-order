# parsing order

DONE
	- comments
	- @import("file.srl"). (goto comments) # important because of '.'-char
		- anywhere save filenames+pathes of already imported files (circular reference!)
TODO
	- split rules-string to rules-list
		- check if rules are syntactically valid # count parens, throw errors
	- check conflicts # if found throw errors
	- find @prints -> print # rules-order must not be changed!
